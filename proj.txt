Gantt chart started

Block diagram started


2010-10-04 

Will use giro instead of compass

// PRINTED

    Compass may be affected by any/every computer in room and too unreliable


2010-10-05 

Started budget


2010-10-11

Will not use giro, redundant with encoders and unjustifiable


2010-10-12 

Making comparison charts


2010-10-27 

Just found out track slip makes encoders difficult for tracks

	Will look into IMUs, gyros

	May have 1 track move forward and other move back at same rate to balance slip (0 point turn)

// PRINTED

2010-11-01 

Gyroscopes are tiny (<1cm x 1cm for big ones) so will use breakout board

	Pins <1mm across

Parts to use (Not firm)

	Lynxmotion Tri-Track Chassis Kit

		Tracked

		Reliable (Have not found major complaints)

		More powerful than Traxster 2

		Indoor/Outdoor

		About same price as Traxster 2

	Lynxmotion GHM-04 Gear motors

		Rear shaft for encoders

		Almost as powerful as GHM-02 provided with kit (best option for gear motors with rear shaft)

	Sabertooth Dual 5A 6V-18V Regenerative Motor Driver

		Regenerative

		Future proof

		Decent price

		Many control options

		Battery protection built in

	Devantech SRF02 Ultrasonic Module

		Cheep

		Good power consumption

		Good range

		I2C & serial interface options

	Parallax LISY300 Gyroscope

		SPI interface

		Decent price

		On breakout board

		Good power consumption


2010-11-03 

May use SD card for data logging

	Uses SPI


2010-11-08 

Processor 

	dsPIC30F6015 looks promising

		Quadrature Encoder Interface looks useful

		Has everything I need

		May be able to use 1 encoder to track distance in straight line


2010-11-22 

Will start to buy components today

Ordered chassis, ultrasonic, gyro, motors, motor controller, encoder, servo from robotshop.ca

	Same as from 2010-11-01 except for the servo 
	
	Servo:
	
		Parallax (Futaba) Continuous Rotation Servo 
		Product code : RB-Plx-180 

Started on multisim

Voltage regulator

	Linear

		http://www.national.com/appinfo/power/files/f4.pdf

		LDO best for batteries

			Operate longer into discharge cycle

	Switching

		http://www.national.com/appinfo/power/files/f5.pdf

		Buck : used to reduce a DC voltage to a lower DC voltage

		Flyback: an O/P Voltage that is less than or greater then the I/P can be generated, as well as multiple O/P

		$3.32

		V_out = 3.3V, 5V

		I_out = 350mA, 430mA

		Seems like best option, will probably use

Battery 

	Probably Ni-Cd or Li-ion

		Can't select until motors arrive (crappy datasheets)

Started to assemble chassis


2010-12-15 

Started testing motors under load

	On chassis

		Empty:

			I_max = 1.3A

			I_ave = 0.73A

		Weight as close to final as I can get (No scale)

			I_max = 1.4A

			I_ave = 0.7A (not consistent or accurate)

Battery 

	Going to assume that the robot will require 1A for 1h for battery research (slightly educated guess)

	V = 7.2V

	Capacity >= 1000mAH

polar coordinates (r, θ) can be introduced as:

    x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ 

Convert degree to rad

	degrees = rad * 180 / 3.1415926

	rad = degree * 3.1415926 / 180
